1. The purpose of my dashboard is to provide stakeholders with insights into customer churn patterns and behavior in the telecommunications industry. I focused on variables such as gender, streaming service usage, contract types, and geographic location to address key questions related to customer retention and satisfaction. By leveraging these variables,I aligned the dashboard with the objectives which include understanding customer demographics, identifying factors influencing churn, and decision-making.
2. The additional dataset from WGU provides valuable context and comparison to the primary dataset from Sunwave Communications, which focuses on California data. By incorporating demographic data from WGU, including non-binary gender options and broader geographic coverage, you gain an understanding of churn patterns and behavior across different regions.
3. I utilized bar charts to visualize churn rates by gender and streaming service usage, allowing executive leaders to identify trends and disparities in customer behavior. Additionally, a geographical map highlights churn by city, which can help executives to prioritize resource allocation and target interventions in high-risk areas. I also utilized box plots to visualize the difference in outcomes when it comes to the type of contract. These data representations support decision-making by providing clear insights into customer churn patterns and behavior.
4. Interactive filters allow users to explore the data based on specific criteria, such as gender, contract type, or geographic region. This enables users to customize their analysis and focus on relevant subsets of the data.
5. I selected color palettes and applied contrast ratios to ensure that visualizations are easily distinguishable for individuals with colorblindness. Additionally, I incorporated alternative text descriptions and tooltips to provide textual context and enhance accessibility for all users.
6. The bar charts I made show how many customers are leaving our company (churning) based on whether they're male or female, and whether they use our streaming service or not. These charts help us tell our story by showing the differences and patterns in how different groups of customers behave. They make our story clearer and more convincing because they show exactly what's happening with our customers, which helps us explain our analysis and suggestions better.
7. Based on this analysis, I tailored the message and content to resonate with the audience, using language, visuals, and examples that are relevant and engaging. By considering the audience's perspective I ensure that the presentation effectively communicates the insights and implications of the analysis in an impactful way.
8. I designed the presentation by incorporating features and accommodations to accommodate diverse user needs. This includes providing alternative text descriptions for visual content, and

organizing information. By prioritizing accessibility, we ensure that all audiences can effectively engage with the presentation.
9. I incorporated narrative arcs and story telling frameworks to structure my presentation in an engaging manner. By framing my analysis as a journey of discovery, I can captivate the audience's attention and have them look forward to the conclusion and recommendations. Additionally I used visual storytelling techniques such as data visualization.
